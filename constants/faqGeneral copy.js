                        CBD, or Cannabidiol, is one of the compounds found in the Cannabis
                        plant which the plant naturally produces. The other well-known
                        compound is tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). THC and CBD are both
                        Cannabinoids, occurring naturally in the cannabis plant. Hemp and
                        Marijuana are two very different strains of the cannabis plant.
                        However, CBD (cannabidiol) does not produce any intoxicating or
                        “high” effects, meaning users can experience its benefits without
                        disconcerting feelings of lethargy or dysphoria.{" "}

            answer: `CBD can be extracted from marijuana flowers of hemp leaves. 
                                But, just to be clear, our CBD comes solely from the Hemp plant ONLY as hemp 
                                plants produce more CBD and contain less than 0.3% THC. This single difference is 
                                what distinguishes hemp from marijuana.`,

                                the ingredient that expressly does not produce a high. CBD provides many benefits that are

        description: `Your body produces its Cannabinoids. Seriously. It does!
                        Cannabinoids are chemical compounds. They are produced naturally in the human 
                        body and also found in plants such as hemp and marijuana.
                        The human body produces Endocannabinoids (endo means ‘within’, as in within the body), 
                        just like cannabis and some other plants produce phytocannabinoids (Phyto – meaning ‘plant’). 
                        Our body also has receptors called CB1 and CB2 designed specifically to recognize and respond to
                         our endogenous cannabinoids.`,
        questions: [
          {
            question: `Why is it called the Endocannabinoid System?`,
            answer: `For starters, it has way too many syllables. But it’s similar to how 
                                research on morphine led to the discovery of endogenous morphine-like chemicals, which 
                                we know as endorphins (‘endo’ meaning). And our bodies have endogenous cannabinoids 
                                and cannabinoid receptors. So, it was named the Endocannabinoid System, or ECS, which 
                                is a network of receptors throughout the body that interact with cannabinoids.`,
          },
          {
            question: `How does ECS work?`,
            answer: `The human body's ECS is responsible for maintaining balance and 
                                essential regulatory functions like sleep, mood, and memory. The ECS relies on 
                                the natural production of endogenous cannabinoids to function properly. Sometimes 
                                we need to supplement our endogenous cannabinoids with cannabinoids from external 
                                sources, such as CBD. When you ingest CBD, it stimulates the ECS which in turn helps 
                                to restore balance and maintain homeostasis.`,

                        interdependent elements, especially as maintained by physiological processes.
                        Your body has a biological system called the endocannabinoid system which is responsible for regulating the
                        functions of sleep, mood, and memory. CBD works by attaching to the receptors in this system and positively
                        impacting these essential functions.`,

        description: `There is CBD from hemp and there is CBD from marijuana.  Bené’s CBD is strictly from hemp.
                        Marijuana and hemp are both members of the cannabis family but a Hemp is a form of cannabis (Sativa).  
                        Like cousins, they do share some characteristics. However, they are not the same thing.
                        The difference being- The amount of psychoactive Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) each plant produces. Hemp contains no more 
                        than 0.3 percent THC. Marijuana contains up to 30 percent THC. And that’s a huge difference. 
                        Marijuana can get you high, while hemp has such a low amount of THC, that it would be is impossible to get high off it. 
                        This means bene CBD will not get you high. Because hemp has no psychoactive effects, the law has no problem with it. It’s legal.`,

            question: `So, is CBD legal?`,
            answer: `If we’re talking about hemp-derived CBD, then the answer is yes. Now, the keyword here is “hemp-derived.” 
                                \Because CBD from hemp has no psychoactive effects. The purchase, sale, or possession of hemp CBD products are completely 
                                legal in all 50 states in the US. Because hemp is sometimes confused with the marijuana plant, there is still some stigma 
                                towards hemp-derived CBD, but from a legal perspective, hemp-derived CBD is completely legal and benefits from enjoys the rights

                        federally legal, but there are a few states that beg to differ. In some states, marijuana-derived CBD is completely legal, while in others, 
                        it is completely illegal. Each state has its CBD-specific laws. While this political indifference has caused a ton of confusion for consumers, 
                        there are a handful of states where hemp-derived and marijuana-derived CBD are completely legal, which just might lead to a

            question: `Has anyone been busted for carrying or intake of CBD?`,
            answer: `Most issues have concerned the CBD manufacturing companies. As for individual consumers, it is highly unlikely 
                                that law enforcement would even bother to ask that person to take a drug test. Law enforcement agencies are focused on the 
                                manufacturers of CBD and are unlikely to bother individual customers. CBD usage is not considered drug usage. In any case, 
                                only extremely high doses of CBD (over 1000+ mg a day frequently) would give a positive result. A modest amount of CBD won't

          {
            question: `Will CBD in the products show up in a Drug Test? `,
            answer: `To be considered legal in the US, CBD products must be derived from industrial hemp which contains less than .3% THC, 
                                or "trace amounts." These trace amounts generally aren't enough THC to show up on a basic drug test, but it is not impossible. 
                                To have a significant amount of THC in your system, you would have to consume an EXTREMELY large dose- potentially over 30–40 
                                times the suggested daily dosage. Usually, CBD never shows up on a drug test however, Drug tests vary as to what compounds are 
                                being analyzed, so we are unable to make any claims or guarantees regarding the use of our products and drug tests.`,

                        content in the extraction far lower than 0.3%. Hence, the resulting CBD oil is legal in all 50 states in the U.S.`,

                                CBD Oil. Solid, pressurized CO2 (dry ice) is pumped through the hemp extracting the oil. CO2 extraction prevents thermal 
                                degradation and helps retain more terpenes and cannabinoids in the oil. The result is a high-quality, full-spectrum CBD oil.`,

          {
            question: `Ethanol extraction`,

                                then evaporated. This extraction method destroys some of the beneficial cannabinoids and chlorophyll which may have health 
                                benefits. While Ethanol extraction is faster and less expensive the resulting CBD Oil is of lower quality when compared to

          },
          {
            question: `Olive oil extraction`,
            answer: `Olive oil extraction requires that the raw hemp plant is first heated (decarboxylated). Then, the olive oil is added 
                                and the mixture further heated to extract the cannabinoids. Olive oil cannot be evaporated away after the extraction. This process 
                                is simple and inexpensive, but the infused olive oil is highly perishable and thus impractical for commercial CBD producers.`,

                        is to start with a low amount, gauge the effects, and go slowly. Simply put, don't go diving into the deep end. 

                        CBD dosing experiments have shown that small doses of CBD have a moderately ‘active’ effect, which means that a modest amount of 
                        CBD is better for focus than a higher amount. Interestingly, large dosages can have a slightly sedative effect. More research is 
                        needed to show exactly what the optimal dosage for anti-anxiety and antidepressant effects is. `,
        questions: [
          {
            question: `Correct dosage of CBD?`,
            answer: `With CBD, some people may find relief with 20 mg twice a day, while others felt better with 200mg of CBD four times a day or even higher. To identify the proper dosage, start low and slow and keep adjusting. If you are new to CBD, try dosing at 10 mg one or two times a day to maintain relief. Increase the dosage to 15 mg or 20 mg twice or three times a day and monitor any changes in your body. Experienced cannabis users can however start at a higher dose, like 25 mg, and adjust from there.`,

            question: `How should I take CBD oil drops?`,
            answer: `The key to taking CBD oil drops is to start one drop at a time. And just as importantly, CBD Oil must be taken under the tongue and held there for 30 to 60 seconds. Why? Sublingual dosing is the fastest way for the active ingredients to absorb into the tiny blood vessels under the tongue. The capillaries under the tongue help carry the CBD oil into our bloodstream within 10-15 minutes. CBD in edibles and capsules can take about 45 minutes. Because of the high rate of absorption, this means that sublingual dosing is also the most cost-effective way to take CBD.`,

        description: `CBD helps in providing an added energy to one’s body when required and remove lethargy by establishing balance in the body. It also provides relief and soothes the person in case of any discomfort. 
                        Feelings of low energy can be caused by a variety of factors – slow metabolism, mental conditions such as anxiety and depression, and simple lack of sleep can all leave us feeling lethargic and struggling to concentrate.
                        Not only has CBD been shown to help increase our metabolism, but an article in the Journal of CNS and Neurological Disorders shows the impact of CBD oil on both energy and mood. The study showed that the therapeutic properties of CBD provide a calming effect, which helps increase concentration.
                        Further research shows CBD’s interaction with dopamine receptors helps regulate the chemical – and processes such as focus and motivation are associated with the release of dopamine in the body. Too much or too little dopamine has both been associated with memory and focus issues, so CBD’s ability to balance dopamine has a positive impact on your ability to focus.
                        Research also shows that CBD helps balance serotonin levels through this interaction with receptors, which leads to more restful sleep, which in turn helps CBD users feel more awake, energized, and able to concentrate.
                        CBD helps your overall mood and energy by balancing out brain chemicals such as dopamine and serotonin, as mentioned above. Therefore, it’s good for both energy and good sleep – after all, you can’t have energy if you aren’t sleeping well!`,
