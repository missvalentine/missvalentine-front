                        CBD, or Cannabidiol, is one of the compounds found in the Cannabis
                        plant which the plant naturally produces. The other well-known
                        compound is tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). THC and CBD are both
                        Cannabinoids, occurring naturally in the cannabis plant. Hemp and
                        Marijuana are two very different strains of the cannabis plant.
                        However, CBD (cannabidiol) does not produce any intoxicating or
                        “high” effects, meaning users can experience its benefits without
                        disconcerting feelings of lethargy or dysphoria.

                        phytocannabinoids (<em>Phyto</em> – meaning ‘plant’). Our body also

                        Feelings of low energy can be caused by a variety of factors – slow metabolism, mental conditions such as anxiety and depression, and simple lack of sleep can all leave us feeling lethargic and struggling to concentrate.
                        Not only has CBD been shown to help increase our metabolism, but an article in the Journal of CNS and Neurological Disorders shows the impact of CBD oil on both energy and mood. The study showed that the therapeutic properties of CBD provide a calming effect, which helps increase concentration.
                        Further research shows CBD’s interaction with dopamine receptors helps regulate the chemical – and processes such as focus and motivation are associated with the release of dopamine in the body. Too much or too little dopamine has both been associated with memory and focus issues, so CBD’s ability to balance dopamine has a positive impact on your ability to focus.
                        Research also shows that CBD helps balance serotonin levels through this interaction with receptors, which leads to more restful sleep, which in turn helps CBD users feel more awake, energized, and able to concentrate.
                        CBD helps your overall mood and energy by balancing out brain chemicals such as dopamine and serotonin, as mentioned above. Therefore, it’s good for both energy and good sleep – after all, you can’t have energy if you aren’t sleeping well!`,
